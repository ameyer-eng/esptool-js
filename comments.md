## Starting with exptools.js

# Builds perfect on Windows 11....not on Ubuntu....?
# 8/3/2022

from the instructions in the README.md 
```
npm install
python3 -m http.server 8008
```
In Ubuntu it does create a server and show the GET/POST commands but when I navigate to http://localhost:8008/
it does not show anything other than a directory.  When I click the links in the directory I can see the GET/POST commands 
on the server terminal returning the files. (INCLUDE SCREENSHOTS??)

ON WINDOWS IT WORKED INSTANT!!  

For now I will continue to develop in Windows as it seems to build correctly. Also more people use Windows.

# Why does Python run the server...I'm not sure....

I will be 100% honest.  This is my first encounter with a npm install that python builds....why not node? 
Why does node not run this? 

npm installs packages for node right????

There is something very fundamental I am not understanding with this.
